This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications. Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.

module that helps prevent reentrant calls to a function.

This can be worked around by making those functions `private`, and then adding `external` `nonReentrant` entry points to them.
